# Devops
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). It is a way of working that helps software teams build, test, and release applications faster and more reliably.

**Without DevOps:**

● Developer writes code → sends to Ops → Ops deploys it → many delays/errors.

**With DevOps:**

● Dev and Ops work as one team → Use automation → Code is tested, deployed, and monitored smoothly and quickly.
